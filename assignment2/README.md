# CSE160 Assignment 2
In this assignment, we want to transform (translation, rotation, scaling, etc)   
simple 2D geometric shapes and 3D objects using matrices.   
To demonstrate the capabilities, we want to create a simple 3D animal using basic shapes.

# Deliverables
- asg2.html : responsible for presenting the visual interface for user to view the animal.    
- asg2.js : responsible for implementing the library for animal representation.  
- Circle.js : provides the function for drawing a circle based upon triangles.    
- Points.js : provides the function for drawing a square based upon the textbook.  
- Triangle.js : provides the function for drawing a triangle based upon the video tutorial.  
- Ellipsoid.js : provides the function for drawing a ellipsoid based upon triangles.  
- README.md : archive of the assignment.   

# Execution
1. Run asg2.html in a browser that supports canvas to initiate the program.
